- Define api fetching from frontend to backend.
-


## ToDo
 - Share tracing information betwen frontend and backend
 -



The api code uses the jaegar client that is deprecated.
As an API developer, write a simple API service using grpc and connectrpc that writes traces and metrics  to an opentelemetry collector. Write the docker compose file for the open telemetry collector, jaegar and zipkins containers for trace visualisation from the api, and prometheus for metrics visualisation.

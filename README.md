## Local Workspace Setup Prerequisites

## Local Application Deployment

### Local Endpoints

| Service | Endpoint |
| Frontend | http://localhost:5050 |
| Api | http://localhost:8080 |
| Jaegar | http://localhost:16686 |
| Otel | http://localhost:4318 |


## Development Application Deployment
- Set environment variable for working directory as root of project.
```bash
    export WORK_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname . )"  &> /dev/null && pwd)"
```
- Install app infra dependencies
```bash
    go install google.golang.org/protobuf@latest
    go install github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@latest
    go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/cmd/grpcurl@latest
    go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
    go install connectrpc.com/connect/cmd/protoc-gen-connect-go@latest
	go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
    go install github.com/sudorandom/protoc-gen-connect-openapi@main


    cd "$WORK_DIR/apps/api"
    go mod download

    cd "$WORK_DIR/internal"
    go mod download

```

- Install app dependencies
```bash
    cd "$WORK_DIR" && npm i
```

- Generate protobuf stubs as needed
```bash
    cd "$WORK_DIR" && npm run buf:generate
```

- Generate api doc files as needed
```bash
    cd "$WORK_DIR" && npm run doc:bundle && npm run doc:gen
```

- Disable telemetry:
```bash
    npx next telemetry disable
```

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx dev listah` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build listah` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
